# FACET
> a **FA**st diamond **C**ut **E**stimator powered by **T**aichi
## Introductions
### Background
I purchased a diamond a few months ago and did some research on the optical properties and processing of the diamond before shopping for it.

I hope to be able to render a beautiful diamond with Taichi and also to do research on the optical properties of diamonds with specific cutting parameters.

## Features
- Parametric model of a round brilliant cut diamond
- Render for intersection with rayâ€“Convex Polyhedron
- Fast spectral rendering 
- Cut Estimator
  - Weighted Light Return
  - Dispersed Colored Light Return
- Adjustable cutting parameter panel

## Getting Started

```sh
pip install taichi 
git clone https://github.com/peng-bo/facet.git
```
